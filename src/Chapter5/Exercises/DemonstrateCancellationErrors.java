//*5.23 (Demonstrate cancellation errors) A cancellation error occurs when you are
//manipulating a very large number with a very small number. The large number
//may cancel out the smaller number. For example, the result of 100000000.0
//+ 0.000000001 is equal to 100000000.0. To avoid cancellation errors and
//obtain more accurate results, carefully select the order of computation. For example, in computing the following summation, you will obtain more accurate
//results by computing from right to left rather than from left to right:
public class DemonstrateCancellationErrors {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

    }
}
