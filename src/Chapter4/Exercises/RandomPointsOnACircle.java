//4.6 (Random points on a circle) Write a program that generates three random points
//on a circle centered at (0, 0) with radius 40 and displays three angles in a triangle
//formed by these three points, as shown in Figure 4.4a. Display the angles in
//degrees. (Hint: Generate a random angle a in radians between 0 and 2p, as shown
//in Figure 4.4b and the point determined by this angle is rx
//cos (a), rx
//sin (a).)
