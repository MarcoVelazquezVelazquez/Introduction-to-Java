//4.7 (Corner point coordinates) Suppose a pentagon is centered at (0, 0) with one point
//at the 0 oâ€™clock position, as shown in Figure 4.4c. Write a program that prompts
//the user to enter the radius of the bounding circle of a pentagon and displays the
//coordinates of the five corner points on the pentagon from p1 to p5 in this order. Use
//console format to display two digits after the decimal point.
